Key features of NMTMaterialTextField include:

1. Customizable Design: The package provides a wide range of customization options, allowing developers to tailor the appearance of the text field to fit their app's visual style. Users can modify properties such as the background color, border color, placeholder text color, and more.

2. Floating Placeholder: NMTMaterialTextField incorporates a floating placeholder label that animates above the text field when the user begins typing, giving a subtle visual indication of the active text field.

3. Error State: Developers can easily trigger an error state for the text field, highlighting it with a different color or style to draw attention to input validation issues or incorrect values.

4. Input Validation: NMTMaterialTextField includes built-in functionality for input validation, allowing developers to set validation rules and provide error messages if the user's input doesn't meet the required criteria.

5. Secure Text Entry: For password or sensitive data input, NMTMaterialTextField supports secure text entry, obscuring the entered characters.

By leveraging the NMTMaterialTextField package, iOS developers can easily incorporate Material Design text fields into their applications while benefiting from the flexibility and customization options provided.
